\section*{Conclusion}

In this article, we have extended the classical Sinkhorn algorithm to cope with streaming samples. The resulting online algorithm computes a non-parametric expansion of the inverse scaling variables using kernel functions. On contrary to previous attempts to compute OT between continuous densities, these kernel expansions fit perfectly the structure of the entropic regularization, which is the key to the practical efficiently of the method and to its theoretical analysis. 
%
This also draws links with non-convex mirror descent methods, which in turn open promising areas of future works to study convergence rates of continuous variants of Sinkhorn's iterations.
