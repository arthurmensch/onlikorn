\section{Conclusion}

We have extended the classical Sinkhorn algorithm to cope with streaming samples. The resulting online algorithm computes a non-parametric expansion of the inverse scaling variables using kernel functions. In contrast with previous attempts to compute OT between continuous densities, these kernel expansions fit perfectly the structure of the entropic regularization, which is key to the practical efficiently.
%
We have drawn links between regularized OT and stochastic approximation. This opens promising avenues to study convergence rates of continuous variants of Sinkhorn's iterations. Future work will refine the complexity constants and design adaptive non-parametric potential estimations.
