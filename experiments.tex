\section{Experiments}

We have introduced and stated convergence results on the online Sinkhorn
algorithms. These convergence results are non-quantitative, and therefore
requires an extensive experiment validation. Our experiments will be three-fold:
first, we show that online Sinkhorn accurately correctly estimate the solutions
of \eqref{eq:wass} and the Sinkhorn distance, overcoming the bias due to
performing sampling only once in the regular Sinkhorn algorithm. Then, we show
that online Sinkhorn accelerates the Sinkhorn algorithm, by estimating sketches
of potentials during the computation of the distance matrix. Finally, we show
how online Sinkhorn allows to estimate potentials with accurate shapes, compared
to SGD with RKHS representations \citep{2016-genevay-nips}.
