We introduce a stochastic method to estimate optimal transport distances between
two continuous probability distributions. Our algorithm handles streams of
points sampled from these distributions, that it uses to iteratively enrich a
non-parametric representation of the transportation plan. This plan is naturally
represented as a mixture of simple (e.g. Gaussian) distributions, of increasing
memory complexity. Compared to the classic Sinkhorn algorithm, our method
handles new samples at each iteration, which permits a consistent estimation of
the true regularized OT distance. We show how our algorithm can be casted as a
block-convex mirror descent in the space of positive distributions; from this
point of view, we analyse its convergence. Empirically, we demonstrate the
efficiency of our estimation compared to concurrent methods.
